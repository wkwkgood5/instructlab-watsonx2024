# Prompt Templates

Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.

Prompt Templates take as input a dictionary, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.

Prompt Templates output a `PromptValue`. This `PromptValue` can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or a list of messages. The reason this `PromptValue` exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.

There are a few different types of prompt templates:

## String PromptTemplates

These prompt templates are used to format a single string and generally are used for simpler inputs. For example, a common way to construct and use a `PromptTemplate` is as follows:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")

prompt_template.invoke({"topic": "cats"})
```
